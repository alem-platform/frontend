This project focuses on developing a modern, responsive, and interactive landing page. The development process consists of three key phases:

- [Static Layout](./m1/README.md) 
    - You need to create the main page and the "Projects" page based on the provided design. The layout should display correctly at a minimum screen width of 1440px.
    - The work will be evaluated for validity and compliance with the design using pixel-perfect principles. 
- [Responsive & Theming](./m2/README.md) 
    - In this stage, you need to make the pages created in the first phase responsive, ensuring proper display down to a minimum width of 380px.
    - All repeated styles must be extracted into CSS variables. Additionally, the light/dark theme switch should be implemented using CSS.
    - The work will be evaluated for validity, pixel-perfect alignment with the layout at the specified page width, responsiveness, and the absence of horizontal scrolling.
- [Interactivity](./m3/README.md)
    - In this stage, you need to enhance the website with interactive elements using JavaScript.
    - Implement a burger menu for mobile navigation, smooth scrolling, a slider for testimonials, a random project display, a scroll-to-top button, and a modal window.

The final product will be a well-optimized and fully functional landing page that provides a seamless experience across all devices.
