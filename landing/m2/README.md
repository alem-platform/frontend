# Landing. Module-2: Responsive & Theming

## Learning Objectives

<!--
    Tip: here you must be a list of learning objectives
    that cover your project
-->

- Responsive design techniques (fluid and adaptive layouts)
- Using CSS variables for repeating styles
- Implementing dark and light themes using CSS
- Keyframe animations in CSS
- Optimizing layouts for different screen sizes
- Pixel-perfect implementation for mobile
- Media query research

## Abstract

<!--
    Tip: Write a short description of what student
    will do during this project.
-->

In this project, you will enhance the static web page from Part 1 by making it fully responsive and implementing theme switching. You will:

- Optimize the current CSS by using CSS variables to replace repeated values such as colors, border-radius, and font sizes, etc.
- Ensure a smooth transition between screen sizes with a responsive and adaptive layout.
- Create a pixel-perfect mobile version of the design.
- Implement dark and light themes using only CSS.

## Context

<!-- Tip: citation is optional -->

> Responsive design is not about making things fit on a screen, but rather about making the experience better for every user.

> â€”  Ethan Marcotte

<!--
    Tip: project context here
    Project context is like an onboarding that should explain briefly
    project problem.

    Think of it like ADR's context section which describes problem.
-->

Modern web development requires responsive and adaptive layouts. In this module, you will work with advanced CSS techniques to ensure a website looks great across all devices while keeping the code clean and maintainable.

- A pixel-perfect design should be implemented specifically for mobile devices.
- Dark and light themes should be implemented using CSS variables and `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Use `@media` queries to handle different breakpoints.
- Implement at least one CSS animation using @keyframes.
- The website must pass the [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) & [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
