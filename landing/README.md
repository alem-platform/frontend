- [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/tO4tO89psRZgHfuuf0wKg5/Alem-Project-Landing)

The project consists of three key parts:

### [m1 - Static Layout](./m1/README.md)

- You need to create the main page and the "Projects" page based on the provided design. The layout should display correctly at screen width of 1440px.
- The work will be evaluated for validity and compliance with the design using pixel-perfect principles.

### [m2 - Responsive & Theming](./m2/README.md)

- In this stage, you need to make the pages created in the first phase responsive, ensuring proper display down to a minimum width of 380px.
- All repeated styles must be extracted into CSS variables. Additionally, the light/dark theme switch should be implemented using CSS.
- The work will be evaluated for validity, pixel-perfect alignment with the layout at the specified page width, responsiveness, and the absence of horizontal scrolling.

### [m3 - Interactivity](./m3/README.md)

- In this stage, you need to enhance the website with interactive elements using JavaScript.

### Summary

The final product will be a well-optimized and fully functional landing page that provides a seamless experience across all devices.
