## Abstract

<!--
    Tip: Write a short description of what student
    will do during this project.
-->

This project focuses on creating a structured, modern website from scratch, following best practices in frontend development. The project consists of three key stages:

- [Landing. Part-1: Fixed Layout](landing-part-1.md)
  - You need to create the main page and the "Projects" page based on the provided design. The layout should display correctly at a minimum screen width of 1440px.
  - The work will be evaluated for validity and compliance with the design using pixel-perfect principles.
- [Landing. Part-2: Responsive & Theming](landing-part-2.md)
  - In this stage, you need to make the pages created in the first phase responsive, ensuring proper display down to a minimum width of 380px.
  - All repeated styles must be extracted into CSS variables. Additionally, the light/dark theme switch should be implemented using CSS.
  - The work will be evaluated for validity, pixel-perfect alignment with the layout at the specified page width, responsiveness, and the absence of horizontal scrolling.
- [Landing. Part-3: Interactive](landing-part-3.md)
  - In this stage, you need to enhance the website with interactive elements using JavaScript.
  - Implement a burger menu for mobile navigation, smooth scrolling, a slider for testimonials, a random project display, a scroll-to-top button, and a modal window.

    Tip: project context here
    Project context is like an onboarding that should explain briefly
    project problem.

    Think of it like ADR's context section which describes problem.
