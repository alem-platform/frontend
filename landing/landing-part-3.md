## Learning Objectives

<!--
    Tip: here you must be a list of learning objectives
    that cover your project
-->

- JavaScript fundamentals
- Event listeners and DOM manipulation
- Implementing smooth scrolling with JavaScript
- Working with classList (add, remove, toggle, contains)

## Abstract

<!--
    Tip: Write a short description of what student
    will do during this project.
-->

In this project, you will enhance your web page by adding interactive features using pure JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks). You will:

- Implement a burger menu for mobile navigation.
- Create smooth scrolling for anchor links using JavaScript.
- Develop an automatic slider for the testimonials section.
- Randomly display three projects on the homepage.
- Add a "scroll to top" button.
- Implement a modal window for additional information display.

## Context

<!--
    Tip: project context here
    Project context is like an onboarding that should explain briefly
    project problem.

    Think of it like ADR's context section which describes problem.
-->

Interactivity is a crucial aspect of modern web development. This module focuses on utilizing vanilla JavaScript to enhance user experience without relying on external libraries.

- The previous criteria from Part-1 and Part-2 still apply.
- Only vanilla JavaScript is allowed. No external libraries or plugins (e.g., jQuery, GSAP, Swiper, Bootstrap, etc.).
- Code must be well-structured and follow [best practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/JavaScript).
- The website must pass the [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) & [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Mandatory Part

### Task List:
- Implement a burger menu that opens and closes the navigation on mobile devices.
- Add smooth scrolling for anchor links using JavaScript (instead of CSS).
- Develop a testimonials slider that auto-scrolls unless interacted with by the user.
- Randomly display three projects from a larger set every time the main page loads.

- Use [emmett](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/faster-html-css-coding-with-emmet-80a66db7ba66) to speed up writing your code in vscode.
- Avoid inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick="function()"`), use `addEventListener` instead.
- Use [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools?hl=ru) to inspect and adjust elements.
